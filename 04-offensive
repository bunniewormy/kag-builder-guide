## What you're going to focus on

Offensive builders mainly focus on constantly pushing pressure on the enemy, pushing (both with knights and solo), with the goal of seriously damaging enemy structures or getting to the enemy flag, while trying to be as much of an annoyance to the enemies as possible.

## Preparation before pushing

Like all builders, offensive builders also need a lot of materials to push. Unlike other kinds of builders, you're likely to die more often, so you will also need to take materials from your base more often too. This is why you want a few trees in a tree farm -- as many as possible -- and a quarry that's constantly running. If nobody is setting up these things -- you should do it yourself so that you can push efficiently. If nobody in your team is putting wood in the quarry, then you should do that every time you respawn as well.

For pushing, we usually want at least 600 wood (but you can as well go with 1000 if you have lots of wood or trees) and a drill (you want to have one almost every time you push). Having some stone -- usually somewhere between 100 and 200, but if you have more then you can take even up to 500 -- can also be a big advantage for blocking enemy doors.

## Material scavenging

You're actually going to try to use as many of your materials as possible before getting killed (because that's how most pushes end up, and you want as many coins as possible). Since our materials are going to be used pretty fast, you want to scavenge any additional materials you can find on the map. Holding C will highlight all materials and other items useful to you on the map.

If some materials are stuck in a 1 block wide gap, like in the gif below, sometimes you won't be able to pick it up. You can however use a trick to get it closer to you -- just place blocks until it goes up.

If you have too many materials and there are additional materials laying around, you can quickly use some of what you have -- you can do that by making simple improvements to the mid base or to the tower. This provides lots of coins which can eventually be used for some offensive tactics when you succeed in a push.

## Observing other players

Offensive playstyle will often require you to try to teamwork with random players in your team, as well as often fight against enemies -- both builders and knights. To be more efficient, you should pay attention to who are the best knights in your team -- so that you can rely on them if you're pushing together, as well as know who in your team isn't that advanced and often repeats the same mistakes (such as opening your doors and accidentally letting enemies kill you). You should also observe how good the enemies are and watch what they are doing -- does the opposing team have any good builder? What are they doing -- do they have a plan and try to base expand, gain control of mid or what? Pay attention to the enemy knights as well -- the best knights in the enemy team are also the most likely to kill you and prevent you from succeeding, so you should be wary of them.

## Pushing

As an offensive builder you will want to push at the enemy structures most of the time. There's a lot that you should keep in mind here.

### Skipping mid or not?

Sometimes the enemy may have control of mid, and that can in certain situations be advantageous to you and give you an opportunity to win with a surprise attack. Basically, if the enemies are focused on keeping control of mid and attacking the enemy structures, as well as ratting sometimes, their tower -- and the flagroom -- is likely to not be well-defended. This happens especially if there's a respawn ballista at a mid base; if you get to the enemy base, you're less likely to get noticed because people are respawning at mid instead of the base. This can cause teams to lose sometimes because of a single builder and one or two knights.

The idea is that you want to go through mid and ignore the enemy ballista or tunnel while not getting too much attention (unless you want to get attention and distract the enemies so that your team can regain control of mid). There's a lot that can happen -- sometimes nobody will even go after you, most of the time only two or three knights will try to get to you, while sometimes it'll be the entire enemy team. However, if the enemy team doesn't chase after you or if it's a single person, that's a big opportunity for you. As with any other push, you should focus on doing as much damage as possible or maybe even try to get the flag -- and if that fails, just survive the longest and distract as many enemies as possible.

Sometimes you can skip mid by getting launched from a catapult at the top of your tower -- if that's possible, you could even get gold and attempt to build a tunnel in the enemy base.

However, keep in mind that you don't always want to skip mid. If your team has problems with defending the tower, you should help with defending or getting control of mid.

### Building quick wooden walls, ledges

Sometimes you may want to quickly make wooden walls in order to skip enemy knights or just not get damaged by them. We're doing it with wood because as mentioned in the first chapter, wood doesn't need as much support from the ground as stone blocks, so we can make over 20 blocks long ledges. This is a great mobility trick that allows you to get past gaps with enemies.

### Building food shops

As we mentioned earlier, we want lots of wood for pushing. If you have lots of wood and you get damaged -- by a slash or any enemy arrow -- you should make a food shop and quickly heal. Doesn't matter where you place the food shop -- you can as well place it as soon as you get damaged. You can also make some quick defenses around it if enemy archers are constantly shooting at you. The point is that you should try to not die until you use up all your materials (to get coins, but to not feed the materials to the enemy as well), so there's no point in saving the wood.

### Analysing enemy tower and making a plan

Pushing is about constantly keeping up pressure and trying to achieve something. It's good to have at least a general goal on what you want to do -- do you want to go on top of the enemy tower and make a knight shop there (and spam kegs if you have coins)? Or maybe you want to collapse a part of it? Or do you just want to annoy the enemies and block all the doors? Or maybe just constantly drill into the flag defenses until one time you are successful?

These are all viable options and we will talk about them in the next sections. Whenever you're in a match, you should look at the enemy tower and analyse its weaknesses to make a plan of action -- for example:

- How many doors does the tower have? How hard would it be to block them all?
- Is there any part of the tower that is made of just stone blocks and would be easily drillable?
- Is there any easy way to get into the enemy knight shop?
- Is there a tunnel or a ballista on top? How hard would it be to get on top of the enemy tower?
- How hard would the tower be to collapse by using various tactics (for example, by bomb arrow spam or just collapsing by destroying backwalls)?

Here are some examples of towers (I tried to pick somewhat good ones, but it's still public CTF) I spotted on random matches on public CTF and what I would do against them as an offensive builder:

It's good to also look at the enemy tower and try to analyse its weaknesses whenever you die and wait for respawn.

### Observing knight fights

Similarly to taking mid, the best way to damage enemy tower is teamwork -- so you need to know when your knights are succeeding in skirmishes. You should watch how your knights are doing when fighting under the enemy tower; check if good knights from your team are there. As soon as they kill the enemies and the opposing team's defense is somewhat weakened, you should start pushing with them. Try to be fast -- the defeated enemies will eventually respawn and get back there.

[GIF]

Your knights won't always succeed though; if they are defeated by enemy knights, you will have to find a less direct way to get to the enemy tower. Sometimes it's better to just retreat and wait for your knights to come back, and sometimes you could try building a ledge and getting over the enemies.

[GIF]

### Killing enemy builders for materials

This applies pretty much any time, especially if you have a drill or you have knights with you -- try to kill the enemy builders and get their materials. The more materials you use, the more effective you can be at supporting your knights by spamming doors and spikes, as well as farming coins for buying kegs or making ledges.

[GIF]

### Scaling the enemy tower -- wallclimbing with stone blocks

You can spam stone blocks below you while constantly jumping and wallclimb the enemy tower. This is usually done when you're pushing solo or there are lots of enemy knights; you also block lots of doors by doing this.

[GIF]

Of course, you can do it with wood blocks as well, but they're much easier to destroy for the enemy builders (as well as knights), so they're less effective. If your goal is just to get to the top of the tower however, then feel free to do it.

### Scaling the enemy tower -- ladders 

Scaling the enemy tower with ladders is most effective if the enemy tower doesn't have many doors and if you have knight support with you. 

[GIF]

Keep in mind that in certain situations your vertically-placed ladders can fall off. This happens if you try to place them next to a single block; in order to not fall off, the bottom part of the ladder needs to be placed next to a block as well. 

[GIF]

This usually happens if you blocked enemy doors and then try building ladders over it. However, there's a simple solution -- you can just rotate the ladders and place them horizontally. They don't fall off in this situation.

[GIF]

When you get to the upper parts of the tower by ladder placing, sometimes enemies will already come to the top and will want to jump down on you. In this case you want to build a ledge over your head with some doors for your knights, as well as some additional side defenses in case enemy knights still try to jump off and slash you.

[GIF]

After such a situation you can either wait for your knights to defeat the enemies or start mining/drilling into the side of the tower.

Sometimes after placing a few ladders, enemy knights may try to come to you from below. This is a good opportunity to drop a spike and kill them.

[GIF]

### Scaling the enemy tower -- platforms 

Some builders sometimes decide to use platforms facing upwards. This can provide some defense from enemy knights jumping down (as well as from spikes if you place two platforms for each time) and lets your knights climb the tower as well, but keep in mind that platforms are easily destroyable by enemy knights as well as that climbing them is slower than climbing ladders. Moreover, placing platforms is slightly slower than solid stone or wood blocks.

[GIF]

### Going into the bottom of the tower

Of course, you won't always want to climb the tower, especially if you can get the flag in an easier way.
Sometimes if the bottom of the tower is sparsely defended you can try going in there. 

A good way is to make some small defences at the bottom of the tower and then start mining/drilling towards it, like in the gif below.

[GIF]

Let's analyse this structure a bit:

[IMG]

As you can see, we're only making one entrance from the side  -- this is because enemy builders will often try to drop a spike from above and kill you; if there were doors, some knight in your team could open it on accident and get you killed.

However, if there was only one layer of stone blocks, an enemy knight could kill you with a bomb. This is because **bombs can kill you through one layer of solid blocks**. This doesn't happen with platforms or with doors (the doors get damaged and absorb all the damage -- keep in mind that a bomb doesn't even destroy the door fully, it just damages it to around 20% health).

[GIF]

This is why we make at least two layers -- this requires the enemy knight to use 2 bombs and gives us some more time to get a bit further into the tower.

When we're inside the tower, standard doorfight tactics apply -- just spam doors and rely on your knights. However, don't trust your knights too much in some cases -- for example, you should block top doors with stone blocks instead of doors if you're going to the side, because your knights could open them accidentally and get you killed.

[GIF]

### Being on top of tower

After getting to the top of the enemy tower, there are various things you can do. First thing you want to do is block all the enemy doors. Make sure to build a ledge with doors from the side you came from as well so that the enemies don't get to you from there either.

[GIF]

If you have lots of coins, now is a good moment to use them. What you can do is quickly build a tall wall and a knight shop on top of it, change to knight and then buy kegs and drop them down. Use up all your materials before changing to knight for as many coins as possible. If there are enemy knights that could collapse the wall, you should use stone instead of wood for the bottom part of it. You can use some additional backwalls too. Place some ladders for your knights as well.

[GIF]

Sometimes people will start building their tower by building one very high column of ladders. You can use this to your advantage by dropping a spike and killing a lot of people (Also, if your tower has that too, you should fix that).

[GIF]

### Destroying enemy tunnel

Pretty much same advice here applies as regarding destroying mid base tunnel; however, there's one additional thing that you can do if the tunnel is on top of the enemy tower (although this can sometimes apply in other situations too). 

Basically, collapsing blocks destroy doors and shops when they fall down. You can make a chunk of wood supported by one backwall and then collapse it like in the gif below to destroy enemy doors and shops.

[GIF]

You can also do this when there are no doors, but this will require destroying a block like in the gif below.

[GIF]

Keep in mind that this only applies to doors. If you ever find yourself in a situation like this but on the defense, you can counter it by just replacing your top doors with wood or stone blocks. 

### Buying kegs in enemy knight shop

Although spamming kegs from top of the tower is good, in some situations buying them in the middle of the enemy base will be more effective. The idea is to get to the enemy knight shop and buy some kegs, then light one of them. One keg's explosion will light the other kegs and you will do a lot of damage to the enemy tower.

[GIF]

### Collapsing the tower

Besides using kegs, you can try to collapse the tower in a different way. If you have a lot of knights with you, but getting to the flag at the current moment would be a bit tricky, you should definitely attempt to collapse the tower.

The best way to collapse a tower is to try to notice the fastest way of destroying them and noticing kind of a line. 

[IMG - line]

You want to use a drill for solid blocks such as wood or stone (try to find a "line" with as many as possible), avoid wasting time on destroying doors unless necessary and finish by destroying backwalls.

There's a trick which lets you destroy backwalls quicker: basically, if you hit a stone backwall one time with your pickaxe, you can replace it with a wooden backwall, which is much easier to destroy than a slightly damaged stone backwall.

## Combat

Although builder isn't a combat class, as an offensive builder you want to be as good at killing as people for maximum effectiveness (it's also quite fun).

- combat:
    - sometimes u actually want to catch bomb and quickly throw back
    - builder pickaxe angle, pickaxe 1v1, using burger, dont engage if u have less hearts

    - when enemy camp on door, getting out and pickaxing in between slashes
    - spikes on background when escaping, placing ladders when escaping for spiking
    - 2heart spikes
    - spiking through gaps or in angles when enemy cant hit you
    - placing spike on ground when enemies digging downwards towards u
    - door angles for attacking (when knight cant hurt u). mention that knight can actually hurt u with new trick
    - blocking knights on an angle like that by placing blocks behind them
    - drilling enemy builders. hiding drill so that enemy builder attacks u
    - when your opponent has drill, doorspam and trying to get his drill to overheat so that it drops so u can steal it. mention that u shouldnt instnatly pick it up because its hot
    - mention that if enemy drill is slightly heated and yours isnt, you should get your heated for more dmg. you should do this even if enemy drill isnt heated too though so that you have an advantage.
    - mention that you can actually use pickaxe at the same time as holding a drill for extra dmg
    - stomping
- making use of enemy tunnels. include watching out for sawtrap and ladder trick.
- offensive catapult attack. place ladders when u get thrown on enemy tower. sometimes with u in crate and epic kneght.
- playing as a knight+builder duo on pubs (maybe some people would want to play more with friends if they knew how to do it properly and well?)
