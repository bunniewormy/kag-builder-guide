# Builder IV: Offensive playstyle

<p align="center">

</p>

## What you're going to focus on

Offensive builders mainly focus on constantly putting pressure on the enemy, pushing (both with knights and solo), with the goal of seriously damaging enemy structures or getting to the enemy flag, while trying to be as much of an annoyance to the enemies as possible.

## Preparation before pushing

Like all builders, offensive builders also need a lot of materials to push. Unlike other kinds of builders, you're likely to die more often, so you will also need to take materials from your base more often too. This is why you want a few trees in a tree farm -- as many as possible -- and a quarry that's constantly running. If nobody is setting up these things -- you should do it yourself so that you can push efficiently. If nobody in your team is putting wood in the quarry, then you should do that every time you respawn as well.

For pushing, we usually want at least 600 wood (but you can as well go with 1000 if you have lots of wood or trees) and a drill (you want to have one almost every time you push). Having some stone -- usually somewhere between 100 and 200, but if you have more then you can take even up to 500 -- can also be a big advantage for blocking enemy doors.

## Material scavenging

You're actually going to try to use as many of your materials as possible before getting killed (because that's how most pushes end up, and you want as many coins as possible). Since our materials are going to be used pretty fast, you want to scavenge any additional materials you can find on the map. Holding C will highlight all materials and other items useful to you on the map.

[GIF]

If some materials are stuck in a 1 block wide gap, like in the gif below, sometimes you won't be able to pick it up. You can however use a trick to get it closer to you -- just place blocks until it goes up.

[GIF]

If you have too many materials and there are additional materials laying around, you can quickly use some of what you have -- you can do that by making simple improvements to the mid base or to the tower. This provides lots of coins which can eventually be used for some offensive tactics when you succeed in a push.

## Observing other players

Offensive playstyle will often require you to try to teamwork with random players in your team, as well as often fight against enemies -- both builders and knights. To be more efficient, you should pay attention to who are the best knights in your team -- so that you can rely on them if you're pushing together, as well as know who in your team isn't that advanced and often repeats the same mistakes (such as opening your doors and accidentally letting enemies kill you). You should also observe how good the enemies are and watch what they are doing -- does the opposing team have any good builder? What are they doing -- do they have a plan and try to base expand, gain control of mid or what? Pay attention to the enemy knights as well -- the best knights in the enemy team are also the most likely to kill you and prevent you from succeeding, so you should be wary of them.

## Pushing

As an offensive builder you will want to push at the enemy structures most of the time. There's a lot that you should keep in mind here.

### Skipping mid or not?

Sometimes the enemy may have control of mid, and that can in certain situations be advantageous to you and give you an opportunity to win with a surprise attack. Basically, if the enemies are focused on keeping control of mid and attacking the enemy structures, as well as ratting sometimes, their tower -- and the flagroom -- is likely to not be well-defended. This happens especially if there's a respawn ballista at a mid base; if you get to the enemy base, you're less likely to get noticed because people are respawning at mid instead of the base. This can cause teams to lose sometimes because of a single builder and one or two knights.

The idea is that you want to go through mid and ignore the enemy ballista or tunnel while not getting too much attention (unless you want to get attention and distract the enemies so that your team can regain control of mid). There's a lot that can happen -- sometimes nobody will even go after you, most of the time only two or three knights will try to get to you, while sometimes it'll be the entire enemy team. However, if the enemy team doesn't chase after you or if it's a single person, that's a big opportunity for you. As with any other push, you should focus on doing as much damage as possible or maybe even try to get the flag -- and if that fails, just survive the longest and distract as many enemies as possible.

[videos? gifs?]

Sometimes you can skip mid by getting launched from a catapult at the top of your tower -- if that's possible, you could even get gold and attempt to build a tunnel in the enemy base.

However, keep in mind that you don't always want to skip mid. If your team has problems with defending the tower, you should help with defending or getting control of mid.

### Building quick wooden walls, ledges

Sometimes you may want to quickly make wooden walls in order to skip enemy knights or just not get damaged by them. We're doing it with wood because as mentioned in the first chapter, wood doesn't need as much support from the ground as stone blocks, so we can make over 20 blocks long ledges. This is a great mobility trick that allows you to get past gaps with enemies.

[GIF]

### Building food shops

As we mentioned earlier, we want lots of wood for pushing. If you have lots of wood and you get damaged -- by a slash or any enemy arrow -- you should make a food shop and quickly heal. Doesn't matter where you place the food shop -- you can as well place it as soon as you get damaged. You can also make some quick defenses around it if enemy archers are constantly shooting at you. The point is that you should try to not die until you use up all your materials (to get coins, but to not feed the materials to the enemy as well), so there's no point in saving the wood.

[GIF]

### Analysing enemy tower and making a plan

Pushing is about constantly keeping up pressure and trying to achieve something. It's good to have at least a general goal on what you want to do -- do you want to go on top of the enemy tower and make a knight shop there (and spam kegs if you have coins)? Or maybe you want to collapse a part of it? Or do you just want to annoy the enemies and block all the doors? Or maybe just constantly drill into the flag defenses until one time you are successful?

These are all viable options and we will talk about them in the next sections. Whenever you're in a match, you should look at the enemy tower and analyse its weaknesses to make a plan of action -- for example:

- How many doors does the tower have? How hard would it be to block them all?
- Is there any part of the tower that is made of just stone blocks and would be easily drillable?
- Is there any easy way to get into the enemy knight shop?
- Is there a tunnel or a ballista on top? How hard would it be to get on top of the enemy tower?
- How hard would the tower be to collapse by using various tactics (for example, by bomb arrow spam or just collapsing by destroying backwalls)?

Here are some examples of towers (I tried to pick somewhat good ones, but it's still public CTF) I spotted on random matches on public CTF and what I would do against them as an offensive builder:

It's good to also look at the enemy tower and try to analyse its weaknesses whenever you die and wait for respawn.

### Observing knight fights

Similarly to taking mid, the best way to damage enemy tower is teamwork -- so you need to know when your knights are succeeding in skirmishes. You should watch how your knights are doing when fighting under the enemy tower; check if good knights from your team are there. As soon as they kill the enemies and the opposing team's defense is somewhat weakened, you should start pushing with them. Try to be fast -- the defeated enemies will eventually respawn and get back there.

[GIF]

Your knights won't always succeed though; if they are defeated by enemy knights, you will have to find a less direct way to get to the enemy tower. Sometimes it's better to just retreat and wait for your knights to come back, and sometimes you could try building a ledge and getting over the enemies.

[GIF]

You should also watch out for bombs from the enemies -- they may decide to throw some at you and damage or kill you.

### Killing enemy builders for materials

This applies pretty much any time, especially if you have a drill or you have knights with you -- try to kill the enemy builders and get their materials. The more materials you use, the more effective you can be at supporting your knights by spamming doors and spikes, as well as farming coins for buying kegs or making ledges.

[GIF]

### Scaling the enemy tower -- wallclimbing with stone blocks

You can spam stone blocks below you while constantly jumping and wallclimb the enemy tower. This is usually done when you're pushing solo or there are lots of enemy knights; you also block lots of doors by doing this.

[GIF]

Of course, you can do it with wood blocks as well, but they're much easier to destroy for the enemy builders (as well as knights), so they're less effective. If your goal is just to get to the top of the tower however, then feel free to do it.

### Scaling the enemy tower -- ladders 

Scaling the enemy tower with ladders is most effective if the enemy tower doesn't have many doors and if you have knight support with you. 

[GIF]

Keep in mind that in certain situations your vertically-placed ladders can fall off. This happens if you try to place them next to a single block; in order to not fall off, the bottom part of the ladder needs to be placed next to a block as well. 

[GIF]

This usually happens if you blocked enemy doors and then try building ladders over it. However, there's a simple solution -- you can just rotate the ladders and place them horizontally. They don't fall off in this situation.

[GIF]

When you get to the upper parts of the tower by ladder placing, sometimes enemies will already come to the top and will try to jump down on you. In this case you want to build a ledge over your head with some doors for your knights, as well as some additional side defenses in case enemy knights still try to jump off and slash you.

[GIF]

In a situation like that you can either wait for your knights to defeat the enemies or start mining/drilling into the side of the tower.

Sometimes after placing a few ladders, enemy knights may try to come to you from below. This is a good opportunity to drop a spike and kill them.

[GIF]

### Scaling the enemy tower -- platforms 

Some builders sometimes decide to use platforms facing upwards. This can provide some defense from enemy knights jumping down (as well as from spikes if you place two platforms for each time) and lets your knights climb the tower as well, but keep in mind that platforms are easily destroyable by enemy knights as well as that climbing them is slower than climbing ladders. Moreover, placing platforms is slightly slower than solid stone or wood blocks.

[GIF]

### Getting launched from a catapult

You can sometimes get yourself launched from a catapult at your mid base or main tower. If you manage to get to the enemy wall, you should place ladders as soon as possible. Same advice as regarding scaling enemy tower with ladders applies here.

[GIF]

Sometimes you can even get launched to the top of the enemy tower.

Another fun thing you can do is get into a crate (hold the crate and press E) and have it picked up by a knight, which is then launched from a catapult.

[GIF]

### Going into the bottom of the tower

Of course, you won't always want to climb the tower, especially if you can get the flag in an easier way.
Sometimes if the bottom of the tower is sparsely defended you can try going in there. 

A good way is to make some small defences at the bottom of the tower and then start mining/drilling towards it, like in the gif below.

[GIF]

Let's analyse this structure a bit:

[IMG]

As you can see, we're only making one entrance from the side  -- this is because enemy builders will often try to drop a spike from above and kill you; if there were doors, some knight in your team could open it on accident and get you killed.

However, if there was only one layer of stone blocks, an enemy knight could kill you with a bomb. This is because **bombs can kill you through one layer of solid blocks**. This doesn't happen with platforms or with doors (the doors get damaged and absorb all the damage -- keep in mind that a bomb doesn't even destroy the door fully, it just damages it to around 20% health).

[GIF]

This is why we make at least two layers -- this requires the enemy knight to use 2 bombs and gives us some more time to get a bit further into the tower.

When we're inside the tower, standard doorfight tactics apply -- just spam doors and rely on your knights. However, don't trust your knights too much in some cases -- for example, you should block top doors with stone blocks instead of doors if you're going to the side, because your knights could open them accidentally and get you killed.

[GIF]

### Being on top of tower

After getting to the top of the enemy tower, there are various things you can do. First thing you want to do is block all the enemy doors. Make sure to build a ledge with doors from the side you came from as well so that the enemies don't get to you from there either.

[GIF]

If you have lots of coins, now is a good moment to use them. What you can do is quickly build a tall wall and a knight shop on top of it, change to knight and then buy kegs and drop them down. Use up all your materials before changing to knight for as many coins as possible. If there are enemy knights that could collapse the wall, you should use stone instead of wood for the bottom part of it. You can use some additional backwalls too. Place some ladders for your knights as well.

[GIF]

Sometimes people will start building their tower by building one very high column of ladders. You can use this to your advantage by dropping a spike and killing a lot of people (Also, if your tower has that too, you should fix that).

[GIF]

### Destroying enemy tunnel

Pretty much same advice here applies as regarding destroying mid base tunnel; however, there's one additional thing that you can do if the tunnel is on top of the enemy tower (although this can sometimes apply in other situations too). 

Basically, collapsing blocks destroy doors and shops when they fall down. You can make a chunk of wood supported by one backwall and then collapse it like in the gif below to destroy enemy doors and shops.

[GIF]

You can also do this when there are no doors, but this will require destroying a block like in the gif below.

[GIF]

Keep in mind that this only applies to doors. If you ever find yourself in a situation like this but on the defense, you can counter it by just replacing your top doors with wood or stone blocks. 

### Buying kegs in enemy knight shop

Although spamming kegs from top of the tower is good, in some situations buying them in the middle of the enemy base will be more effective. The idea is to get to the enemy knight shop and buy some kegs, then light as many as you can. One keg's explosion will light the other kegs and you will do a lot of damage to the enemy tower.

[GIF]

However, enemies can buy a water bucket and extinguish the kegs (even through doors). If this happens, just light the keg again.

[GIF]

### Collapsing the tower

Besides using kegs, you can try to collapse the tower in a different way. If you have a lot of knights with you, but getting to the flag at the current moment would be a bit tricky, you should definitely attempt to collapse the tower.

The best way to collapse a tower is to try to notice the fastest way of destroying its support and noticing kind of a line. 

[IMG - line]

You want to use a drill for solid blocks such as wood or stone (try to find a "line" with as many as possible), avoid wasting time on destroying doors unless necessary and finish by destroying backwalls.

There's a trick which lets you destroy backwalls quicker: basically, if you hit a stone backwall one time with your pickaxe, you can replace it with a wooden backwall, which is much easier to destroy than a slightly damaged stone backwall. 

[GIF]

### Using enemy tunnels

Not that strictly related to pushing, but sometimes you can use an enemy tunnel (for example their mid base one) to travel to another one (tent one or tower one). However, you should be careful and check earlier (for example when waiting for respawn) if the enemy tunnel you're travelling to has a sawtrap. You should be wary of enemy mines on the tunnels as well (they'll instantly kill you).

[GIF]

Actually, there's also a trick that can let you avoid sawtraps. The idea is to place a ladder in the room with the tunnel and while climbing both vertically and horizontally on the ladder (holding W + A/D) use the tunnel. This will make you move slightly after teleporting to the other tunnel and avoid the sawtrap. Other knights in your team can do this as well.

[GIF]

This however can also be countered if the spot with the sawtrap is as wide as the tunnel (5 blocks wide with a saw in the center). Doing the ladder trick will still make you bounce off the wall into the sawtrap.

[GIF]

## Combat

Although builder isn't a combat class, as an offensive builder you want to be somewhat good at killing people for maximum effectiveness as well (it's also quite fun).

### Using doors at certain angles to damage knights 

This is arguably the most powerful combat trick for builders; there's a certain angle which lets you damage knights by pickaxe without them being able to damage you by slashes. In the image below, the knight is unable to damage you by slashing (unless by a generally unknown trick that I'll mention later), while you're able to damage him by a pickaxe or drill.

[IMG]

Basically, the way it works is that whenever a knight attack a door, the door absorbs the damage of the slash/jab and the slash/jab's arc (which starts from the top) doesn't continue past the door. In this situation, the knight can only attack the door. You can however still attack them.

[GIF]

You can often force yourself into such situations by being at a lower level than the enemy players and placing doors properly.

[GIF]

Knights will often think that they should be able to damage you and get closer to you. You can also place a block behind them when they get close so that they don't run away.

[GIF]

Make sure to not open the door accidentally -- the enemies can go through it and then be able to kill you.

Now, the thing is, that the enemy knight is actually able to slash you by starting his slash so that it doesn't hit the door and then moving the slash arc to hit the enemy builder (starting the slash from the opposite side and quickly moving the direction he's pointing to by 180 degrees with his mouse downwards, not hitting the door at all)

[GIF]

However, barely anyone knows about this and you'll be able to kill a majority of the knights without getting any damage.

This angle works similar in a situation like in the gif below as well, but if the knight doesn't aim directly at you and slashes slightly downwards then they will also damage you. It's also a bit more dangerous to try damaging them at this angle because you can accidentally open the door.

[GIF - swap places]

Keep in mind that enemy builders can attack you at both of these angles.

[GIF]

### Enemy knights glitching in the doors

Sometimes if you open doors for a short moment for the enemy knights and they have slight lag, they will get stuck in a closed door and you will be able to damage them while they aren't able to damage you.

[GIF]

### Pickaxe 1v1 with other builders

Whenever you're doing a 1v1 with other builders, you should try to spike them first somehow to get a heart advantage and then finish them with a pickaxe. If you don't have any way to do that, then the result of the 1v1 will depend on whoever damaged the enemy player first. To do that, you should start attacking them with your pickaxe as soon as they're in your range.

[GIF]

[GIF]

Another way to win the 1v1 is if you have a burger -- eat it to heal yourself after losing some health.

[GIF]

Generally try to not engage in pickaxe 1v1s if you have fewer hearts than the enemy.

Spamming the right mouse button instead of holding it makes no difference.

### Heating drill before combat

Since the drill does more damage when heated (with a red tint), before engaging in a 1v1 with a builder that has a drill (or any other fights) you should first make sure yours is slightly heated. You can do it by using it for a moment on any blocks.

[GIF]

### Hiding drill from enemy builder

You can try to make the enemy builder think that you have no drill by keeping it in your inventory and provoke them to attack you, and then take it out and kill them.

[GIF]

### Using pickaxe + drill at the same time

You can use a drill and a pickaxe at the same time for extra damage (hold both left and right mouse buttons).

[GIF]

You can do this when destroying blocks too.

### Killing knights with low health

You can easily kill knights that have half a heart or sometimes one heart, even with your pickaxe -- attack them in between their slashes.

[GIF]

[GIF 2 - door fuzzle meta]

### Stealing enemy builder's drill

Sometimes you may want to not fight against a builder with a drill -- especially if you don't have one yourself. The idea is to bait them and get them to drill doors in a doorfight -- spam lots of doors. They may overheat their drill on your doors. You will want to wait a short while (you can't pick up a drill right after it overheated) -- about 1 second -- and pick it up from the ground. You can also use the drill to kill the enemy (make sure to not just instantly overheat it again though).

[GIF]

### Offensive spiking

You can drop spikes at enemies in a lot of situations due to the block placing range. You can make use of the door-related angle mentioned earlier as well. Some examples are in the gifs below.

[GIF]

### Dirt spikes against enemies digging down

If the enemies are digging down towards you, you can place some spikes on dirt (or on wood) right before they fall down and damage them. This can of course be countered by placing ladders, but it still works sometimes.

[GIF]

### Escape spikes

If you're escaping from a knight and there's some backwall around, you can drop spikes as the enemy is going towards you and even kill them.

[GIF]

You can also place some ladders and spike them as they get close.

[GIF]

### Double hit spikes

Spikes can deal two hearts of damage by hitting the same enemy twice. If the enemy is jumping towards you, you should place a spike below them right as he starts falling down. They will fall through the spike and the spike will hit them again, like in the gifs below.

[GIF]

[GIF]

### Stomping

You can fall down on enemy builders (as well as knights, but that's a bit more dangerous) to stomp them while dealing some damage and stunning them. You can combine it with using a spike right after or drilling them.

[GIF]

### Crouching

Crouching is when you hold down the S (move down) button. This causes your collision hitbox to disappear -- enemies will be able to go through you. You can't move for this to work (if you move, they'll collide with you even if you hold S). This can be used to avoid being stomped by enemies.

[GIF]

[GIF]

### Dirt spike + crouch

This doesn't work very often, but if enemies are digging downwards towards you, you can place dirtspikes below yourself and then crouch and have them fall down into the spikes.

[GIF]

### Catching and throwing back enemy bombs

Enemy knights can sometimes throw a bomb too early and give you enough time to catch it and throw it somewhere else.

[GIF]

If you're being attacked by several enemies at once, you can catch an enemy bomb and suicide with it killing some enemy builders.

[GIF]

## Playing with a knight friend

Playing as an offensive builder+knight duo in public CTF matches in my opinion is one of the best ways to experience KAG. Since you don't have to rely on random people you can actually teamwork much better and win stalemates, as long as your knight defends you and supports you as much as they can: follows you, catches enemy bombs, gives you materials from enemy builders and helps you during doorfights.

[GIF]

[GIF]

Besides launching yourself from a catapult in a crate held by a knight, your knight friend can also bomb jump with you in a crate.

[GIF]

If your knight friend drops resupply materials when respawning (changes to builder and back to knight), you'll also have more materials and be more effective at pushing.

[GIF]
